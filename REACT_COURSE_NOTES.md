## About
This project is the conceptual part of React Course I made by @matheusbattist.
ReactJS is Library for front-end Development. 
I dedicated my life during one month and six days ( including the second part of course ) learninhg and practicing ReactJS and I hundestand this is only the begining of my journey to solidify that hard skill .

This project also has been used by me to  `learn` and  `train` ReactJS. 


## `CLASS 1` - INTRODUCTION TO REACT
  - Overview of the project wil be created in the course
  - Technical Requirements
  - Notion and Concepts aout React
  - ReactJS is library for web interface creation
  - It is used to build SPAs (Single Page Application)
  - Component Based
  - Use JSX to render HTML
  - Apply virtual DOM to make/execute changes from DOM
  - We can add it to a project or create one with React

## `CLASS 2` - INSTALL REACT
  - We use `create-react-app (CRA)`  tool to create a react app
  - CRA is a script execution tool to create a React Application, where that execution is performed through `nodejs`  and  `npm`
  - `npm start` initialize a react app in dev

#### STEPS TO CREATE A REACTJS APP

##### STEP 1 - INSTALL `npm` and `react`
Access -> [React Dev](https://react.dev/)

##### STEP 2 - CREATE A REACT APP USING `create-react-app` tool
Access -> [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev)

**RUN COMMAND:**  `npx create-react-app` [YOUR_APP_NAME]
    
##### STEP 3 - AFTER APP HAS SUCCESSFULY CREATED
  Unce React App has been successfuly created, folow the `Steps` in file 
  [README.md](https://github.com/idelfrides/LearningReactJS/blob/main/README.md)
  

## `CLASS 3` - UNDERSTANDING JSX FILES  

  - `JSX` is similar to HTML, but it wrote inside a javascript code
  - Is mean way to write HTML with RactJS
  - We can interpolate variables by putting them inside { }
  - It possible to execute functions in JSX-Inser variables in `tags atributtes` is algo possible


## `CLASS 4` - UNDERSTANDING JSX FILES  

  - Allow to split the Application in part
  - The Components render JSX such as `APP.js`
  - Component need a js file with same name. 
  - Components can be imported to any part of Application as many time you need
  - Normlay they stay in folder called  `components`
  - A Component is a javascript function, it name must be equal to his file name
  - They can be used in many other components

## `CLASS 5` - UNDERSTANDING JSX FILES  

  - `props` are values passed to a Component
  - They may be used dinamicaly
  - The value is passed as argument when calling a Component
  - That value need to be recovered from inside a parameter, normly `props`.    - `props` are read-only
