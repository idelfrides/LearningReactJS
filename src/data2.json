    "class_1": "Overview of project-Technical Requirements-Notion and Concepts about React-React is a library for web interface creation-It is used to build SPAs (Single Page Application)-Is Component Based-Use JSX to render HTML-Apply virtual DOM to make/execute changes from DOM-We can add it to an existing project or create a new one with React.",
    "class_2": "We use 'create react app' (CRA) tool to create a react app-CRA is a script execution tool to create a React Application, where that execution is performed through 'nodejs' and 'npm'-'npm start' initialize a React app in dev",
    "class_3": "JSX is similar to HTML, but it wrote inside a javascript code-Is mean way to write HTML with RactJS-We can interpolate variables by putting them inside { }-It possible to execute functions in JSX-Inser variables in  `tags atributtes` is algo possible",
    "class_4": "Allow to split the Application in part-The Components render JSX such as APP.js-Component need a js file with same name. Components can be imported to any part of Application as many time you need-Normaly they stay in folder called  `components`-A Component is a javascript function, it name must be equal to his file name-They can be used in many other components",
    "class_5": "props are values passed to a Component-They may be used dinamicaly-The value is passed as argument when calling a Component-That value need to be recovered from inside a parameter, usually `props`.-props are read only",
    "class_6": "`CSS` can be added by global way to React App through 'index.css' file-However, it possible styling at Component level-For that, It used 'CSS modules'-Create a file with this pattern '[COMPONENT_NAME].module.css' and import that css file as with key 'styles' in its own Component-Inside CSS modules files, use classes name in `Camel case` or `snake case`",
    "class_7": "`React fragments` allow to create a Component without a superior element-The purpose is `uncomplicate DOM nodes`-The syntax is `<> ... </>` without tag name-It created in JSX",
    "class_8": "We can `define type for props`, making a kind of validation-We do it in an object called `PropTypes` in Component-It possible to set a default value-To do that, use object `defaultProps`",
    "class_9": "Types: `onClick`, `onChange`, `onSubmit`-React events are the same events of DOM, we have events to respond a click-The event is associate to a tag that will execute it-Generally a `method` is assigned to the event-That `method` have to be `created in Component`",
    "class_10": "`useState` is a React Hook-With it we can `manage the state` of a Component in a simple way-This Hook `works so well with events`-It possible to assign an event to state changing",
    "class_11": "`Methods` can be passed by props also-In other words, a `Component child can activate a method from his father`-Let's access the method through an event-The syntax is the same as a data props:-Like this -> `props.methodName`"
